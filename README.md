# HTML and CSS Projects
 HTML for course and assignmens

These are my sample websites I have created so far on my course.
They include:

My Academy Cinemas Website
https://github.com/irwinc27/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/blob/main/Bootstrap/academy_cinemas.html

This site was created using Bootstrap 4, including jumbotron, navbar, form cards and drop down elements.

My Space Station Website
https://github.com/irwinc27/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/blob/main/MyTechProjects/index.html

A space station site made using Visual Studio Code, with styling elements in CSS, with a navbar, image containers and a form.
